# Week 1 Quiz:

# Simple function

def f(x):
    return - 5 * x ** 5 + 69 * x ** 2 - 47

print f(0), f(1), f(2), f(3)

# Compound Interest

def future_value(present_value, annual_rate, periods_per_year, years):
    rate_per_period = annual_rate / periods_per_year
    periods = periods_per_year * years

    # Put your code here.
    return present_value * (1 + rate_per_period) ** periods

print "$1000 at 2% compounded daily for 3 years yields $", future_value(1000, .02, 365, 3)

# Regular Polygon's Area

import math

def area(number_sides, length_sides):
    return (number_sides * length_sides ** 2) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / number_sides))
    
print area(7, 3)

# Fix Syntatic Errors

def project_to_distance(point_x, point_y, distance):
    dist_to_origin = math.sqrt(point_x ** 2 + point_y ** 2)
    scale = distance / dist_to_origin
    return point_x * scale, point_y * scale

print project_to_distance(2, 7, 4)
