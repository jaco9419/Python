# Given any initial natural number, consider the sequence of numbers generated by repeatedly following the rule:

# divide by two if the number is even or
# multiply by 3 and add 1 if the number is odd.
# The Collatz conjecture states that this sequence always terminates at 1. For example, the sequence generated by 23 is:

# 23, 70, 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

import simplegui

# global state

number = 217

# helper functions
def update():
    global number
    print number
    if number % 2 == 0:
        number = number / 2
    elif number == 1:
        timer.stop()
    else:
        number = number * 3 + 1
    
# timer callback

def tick():
    update()

# register event handlers

timer = simplegui.create_timer(100, tick)

# start program
timer.start()
